# Here the instructions define your application as a service called "server".
# This service is built from the Dockerfile in the current directory.
# You can add other services your application may depend on here, such as a
# database or a cache. For examples, see the Awesome Compose repository:
# https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose
services:
  server:
    build:
      context: .
    ports:
      - 5050:80
    volumes:
      - ./instance:/web/instance
      - ./userdata:/web/userdata
    #  - ./userdata/chrome:/web/userdata/chrome
    #  - ./userdata/.cache:/web/userdata/.cache
    environment:
      SLACK_API_KEY: ${SLACK_API_KEY}

# The commented out section below is an example of how to define a PostgreSQL
# database that your application can use. `depends_on` tells Docker Compose to
# start the database before your application. The `db-data` volume persists the
# database data between container restarts. The `db-password` secret is used
# to set the database password. You must create `db/password.txt` and add
# a password of your choosing to it before running `docker compose up`.
#     depends_on:
#       db:
#         condition: service_healthy
#   db:
#     image: nouchka/sqlite3:latest
#     stdin_open: true
#     tty: true
#     volumes:
#       - ../instance/app.sqlite:/instance/app.sqlite
#     image: postgres
#     restart: always
#     user: postgres
#     secrets:
#       - db-password
#     volumes:
#       - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
#     environment:
#       - POSTGRES_DB=example
#       - POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/db-password
